I am a first-year master student at [Mila - Québec AI Institute](https://mila.quebec/)supervised by Prof. [Jian Tang](https://jian-tang.com/). Prior to this, I earned a master's degree in System Engineering from the Sino-French Engineering School at Beihang University, where I was supervised by [Prof Wenge Rong](https://wgrong.github.io/) & [Prof Yuanxin Ouyang](http://scse.buaa.edu.cn/info/1078/7375.htm). Additionally, I hold a general engineering diploma from [École Centrale de Lille](https://centralelille.fr/) in France.

<!-- I was also a machine learning engineering intern at ByteDance Inc., where I worked on recommender systems under the supervision of Yitan Li.

My name is Chuanrui Wang, a Master's student at Beihang University. I am majoring in System Engineering and supervised by [Prof Wenge Rong](https://wgrong.github.io/) & [Prof Yuanxin Ouyang](http://scse.buaa.edu.cn/info/1078/7375.htm). 

During my undergraduate period in Beihang University, with an outstanding academic performance (rank 8th/120), I was selected to participate in an exchange program to l’Ecole Centrale de Lille in France and study there for 2 years. -->

I am currently looking for a PhD's research position. Please check my [CV](/files/CS.pdf) for further information.
