My name is Chuanrui Wang, a Master's student at Beihang University. I am majoring in System Engineering and supervised by [Prof Wenge Rong](https://wgrong.github.io/) & [Prof Yuanxin Ouyang](http://scse.buaa.edu.cn/info/1078/7375.htm). 

During my undergraduate period in Beihang University, with an outstanding academic performance (rank 8th/120), I was selected to participate in an exchange program to lâ€™Ecole Centrale de Lille in France and study there for 2 years.

I am currently looking for a PhD's research position. Please check my [CV](/files/CS.pdf) for further information.
