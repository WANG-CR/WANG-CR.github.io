Education
======
* M.S. in System Engineering, Beihang University　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　&nbsp;Aug 2020 - July 2022 (expected)
* Generalist Engineer (= Master of Engineering), Centrale Lille　　　　　　　　　&nbsp;&nbsp;Aug 2018 - July 2020    
* B.S. in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics, Beihang University　　　　　　　Aug 2015 - July 2018


Research Experiences
======

**Research in natural language generation and pre-trained language models  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nov 2020 - Present**              
Advisor: Wenge RONG, Professor, School of Computer Science and Engineering, Beihang University
* Researched and applied Knowledge graph (KG) embedding methods to generate contextualized natural languages with more details.
* Proposed an attention-based knowledge filter mechanism to filter out irrelevant knowledge. 
* Proposed a hierarchical lexicon embedding structure to solve Chinese named entity recognition task and achieved SOTA in 3 commonly used Chinese dataset.


**Integrated Large-Scale Model Training System with Efficient Parallelization Techniques  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aug 2021 - Present**                   
Advisor: Yang YOU, Professor, School of Computer Science and Engineering, National University of Singapore
* Models and datasets are getting significantly larger, making a single GPU not enough to accommodate the entire model.
* Developed a distributed machine learning framework that combines hybrid parallel training methods, aiming to
support the AI community to write distributed models in the same way as how they write models normally.
* Conducted experiments on the developed system, e.g. scaling test/ performance alignment test on ViT-ImageNet. 

**Straightforward Neural Network Method for Mesh Smoothing  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sep 2020 - Nov 2020**                   
Advisor: Yufei GUO, PhD Researcher, X lab
* Proposed a the first neural network approach to solve mesh smoothing problem.
* Achieved efficiency 4 times faster than traditional optimization-based methods while being comparable in terms of mesh quality.


Internship Experiences and Projects 
======
**Ainnovation, Department of Industrialized Computer Vision | R&D Intern | Beijing &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jul 2020 - Sep 2020** 
* Built an Intelligent Edge Video Platform providing real-time functional interfaces that are adaptable to various commercial applications in terms of model development and hardware compatibility.  (https://www.ainnovation.com/mmo/matrixvision)
* Developed and encapsulated core functions of the platform including video/photo encoding, decoding, cropping, augmenting, etc. on Huawei HiSilicon chip (C++).
* Trained and deployed 2 sub-applications on the platform: online face recognition system and kitchen monitoring system.

**Online Chinese Chess Game | WEB course project | Lille &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;June 2020 - June 2020** 
* Created a game application on web page which permits two players on different web browsers to participate in the same match on live (Documentation).
* Defined the specifications of gameplay, functions and main user interface.
* Developed both front end and back end. Realized the database, registration and sign-in, web page display, as well as game realization.

**Drone Project, BL evolution (https://www.bl-evolution.com) | Co-Leader | Lille &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dec 2018 - Feb 2020**
* Designed and assembled devices (drones) to measure various environmental data from the air.
* Participated in project establishment, budget estimation, schedule arrangement, work allocation, and final product delivery.
* Assembled sensors on Raspberry Pi to monitor/record/store data.
* Processed the observed data, represented the analytical results on a map database, and applied target detection to the images to identify thermal energy, roof ridges, or green coverage.


**Using wavelet transform and gradient descent to trait image and audio signals | Lille &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feb 2020 - Feb 2020**
* Applied Haar wavelet transform and discrete wavelet transform in image processing projects to make images transformed with multi-resolution and multi-scale capability 
* Rendered very large gradient values on image edges for object edge detection without training.  
* Performed noise removal and image restoration on unclear image sets.
* Applied Haar wavelet transform for noise reduction and audio segmentation
